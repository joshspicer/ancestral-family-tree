# Family Tree

Ancestor family tree viewer with [D3](http://d3js.org/) v3. Heavily based on the work done by [justincy](https://github.com/justincy/d3-pedigree-examples).

My use case is to help me organize documents for my Italian dual-citizenship (ex: Jure Sanguinis) applications.

An example (with missing data) can be found hosted on this repo's github page (https://joshspicer.com/ancestral-family-tree)

Set your own data by modifying [this line](https://github.com/joshspicer/d3-pedigree-examples/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L89).
